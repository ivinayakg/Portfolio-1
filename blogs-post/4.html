        <h1>We All Hate<spam class="highlight">Rejection</spam></h1>
        <small>Published on August 2021</small>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6rem; letter-spacing: 0.1rem">
          As people, we all from time to time go through a phase of rejection,
          and no matter how modest we try to react and how much we say it's ok
          or I don't care it hurts like hell. Rejection I think makes you feel
          like there is something wrong with "YOU" which is kind of absurd.<br />
          In this phase, I try to think of who is right and who is wrong but the
          answer is no one is which makes this even more complicated, I haven't
          done anything wrong to get rejected but at the same time,<br />
          there is nothing wrong with rejecting me. Things will not always
          happen just the way you wanted and again there is nothing wrong with
          that.<br />
          There is nothing wrong with people wanting something different than
          you want. Now don't try to hold on to this feeling let yourself feel
          it express it to yourself but in the end, let it go. Don't try to
          justify this rejection because it's ok to feel embarrassed about it
          although there is nothing to be embarrassed about.<br />
          It's ok to be sad and hurt but not let this change your trajectory of
          life because, in the end, your life is all about you and no one else.
          Try to be humble to the person who has rejected you because there is
          nothing wrong that they have done to not deserve that.<br />
          In the end, it will work out for the betterment of you only which is
          in the long term a great thing.
