        <h1>Broken From The<spam class="highlight">Inside</spam></h1>
        <small>Published on August 2021</small>
        <p>
          Sometimes you just sit around doing nothing and this thought just
          comes to knock your head at the back that life is just so beautiful
          even after that you are broken from the inside,<br />
          have a sense of emptiness and loneliness, you should probably stop and
          give up on life but if you have just a single drop of hope in your
          heart for a better tomorrow then you can look past all your
          inadequacies and still would be able to see how beautiful the world
          is.<br />
          The single fact that my action will always change who I would be in
          the future is just so inspiring to me. In the time of crisis,<br />
          this is the single most important as well as difficult thing to do and
          that is taking 100% responsibility that everything that is happening
          in your life is because of you.<br />
          Will make you so small but will give you the power to make a different
          decision and therefore a different life. We all want to be special but
          why?<br />
          what is that being special is going to give us that not being doesn't
          or is there even something we need or<br />
          it's just something we think we NEED?
