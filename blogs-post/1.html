        <small>Published on August 2021</small>
        <p>
          The modern world is steadily developing. Standards of web development
          sometimes tend to change faster before we try to implement it. So, are
          you ready to do some innovation with your web application in 2021? We
          need to identify the trend, approach, and techniques gaining
          popularity this year to focus on it.<br /><br />

          It is also required to analyze the tendencies of the industries, for
          which we can find out the lists of the hottest web technology stacks
          worth your attention in the coming year to become pioneers in your
          niche. These new trends make the entrepreneurs dig up more
          opportunities, remain engaged, and stay competitive irrespective of
          your web business- startup innovations, market development, or IoT
          inventions.<br /><br />

          1. Voice Search <br />
          Technology seems to get better every year, and in Voice recognition
          software, there is no difference. From Siri to Alexa, voice search is
          equipped for every smartphone and can boast a 90% accuracy rate, the
          same as most humans. According to the statistics, thousands of new
          voice command devices empowered with AI are being sold every day
          worldwide due to their incredible popularity.<br /><br />

          People choose this hands-free technology in this digital world,
          eliminating the hassle of getting the information by inputting the
          search question by their hands, saving time and effort. However, why
          is this shift towards voice interface taking place among the users?
          The answer is-<br /><br />

          Accessible to Use: Communication is something that we didn’t require
          to learn; children and elders can use the devices for searching for
          any information by interacting with the voice interface.
          Affordability: Voice search has been a common feature in every
          smartphone nowadays.<br /><br />
          Helpful in Business<br />

          Optimizing your business with voice search by boosting it with local
          SEO will make a significant buzz on your web business. It builds a
          solid and potential audience by generating sales and coming up with
          blogger revenue in return.<br />

          2. Web Assembly<br />

          Sometimes building a web app, there is a sort of compromise in which
          the performance does not occur up to the mark. Due to JavaScript
          limitations, calculations get slower and affect the user experience.
          Hence, popular games and high-end apps are only available on native
          desktops.<br />

          To change the game, Web Assembly helps you to focus on the native-like
          performance among web apps. Web Developers code the programming
          language by compiling it into bytecode, which runs in a browser faster
          than JavaScript.<br />

          A website’s intuitiveness, smoothness, and compilation of the
          offerings in easy-to-locate sections are extremely important for
          improving the site’s usability and customer experience. You will find
          it vital if you have visited a website (like casino.netbet.com) to
          play casino games online. Encompassing entertaining bonus offers and a
          wide array of betting options corresponded by industry-standard odds
          are always the first aspects to emphasize. But, an experienced and
          renowned site will always want its users to conveniently locate their
          preferred betting options without any hindrances.<br />

          Helpful in Business<br />

          Leveraging the power of web assembly, web apps are progressing day by
          day. The technology is worth trying out if you wish to build an online
          image, web game, music apps, 3D mapping apps, and creating interactive
          educational training apps.<br /><br />

          3. Progressive Web Apps and Accelerated Mobile Pages<br />

          We search for web apps that we can access the entire content quickly
          on mobile. Hence, we need to implement PWA or AMP, which are
          incredibly unique technologies that minimize the loading time of a web
          page on mobile. Most people use their mobile to satisfy their desired
          needs. For that, this technology is apt to make the websites
          user-friendly.<br />

          With the help of a progressive web page, working online has become
          more manageable even if you have a poor internet connection, and it is
          relatively fast and low cost. It also enhances users’ enjoyment of a
          high-end experience, and they hardly realize that they are using a
          browser. Generally, e-commerce web apps use this type of technology
          for quicker launch in the online market.<br />

          Although this technology is comparatively new, many web businesses use
          this technology daily without even mentioning it! Like Twitter, with
          330 million active users, some promote their business in other ways
          for striking success. You can build a web game by considering this
          approach, an entertainment app, create an entirely different news
          website, or do some innovation in a lifestyle or sports apps; you
          should think of the PWA approach to get success from your output.<br /><br />

          4. Motion UI<br />

          The most popular web design trend of the coming year is motion design.
          Minimalistic design is simple but informative, coupled with a
          sophisticated interactive design, looks good, and draws user
          attention.<br />

          Developers use motion design in page header transitions, animated
          charts, nice hovers and background animations, and modular scrolling.
          These may seamlessly drag the customer’s attention towards your brand
          site or app, nurturing a unique style and entertain the user.<br /><br />

          Helpful in Business If you want to increase the engagement of your
          website among the users, provide a better UI/UX to your web app’s
          users, and make it stand out of the crowd by incorporating some
          elements of motion UI techniques in your site.<br />

          Design your app with animative substances, guide your user by
          navigating the direction icons which step to take next. Catchy
          animations always work well in providing an excellent gesture to the
          users.<br /><br />
          Conclusion<br />

          Since the trends are changing so fast, it is pretty hard to chase
          them. However, you can implement the latest trends in web development
          by improving the web page ranking. Also, you can satisfy your users by
          adapting to the new technology and opening new markets for your
          services.
